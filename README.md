## Description

How would you like to have all your Pokemon cards and carry them with you everywhere? Here at Squirtle Squad weâ€™ve created Pokedeck, THE Pokemon trading card app of the future, where anyone from 6 and up can virtually collect any iconic Pokemon card that they've ever dreamed of. When you first start off, you get a booster pack of 10 cards. And every day that you log in, you get a free card to add to your collection. As a collector, you will compete against other collectors to create the highest value deck, so put those cards down and step into the future with Pokedeck.
